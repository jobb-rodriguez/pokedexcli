# Testing
## Unit Testing
It is a form of software testing by which isolated source code is tested to validate expected behavior. (Wikipedia)

## Test-driven Development (TDD)
It is a way of writing code that involves writing an automated unit-level test case that fails, then writing just enough code to make the test pass, then refactoring both the test code and the production code, then repeating with anoter new test case.

> [!NOTE]
> Soon, refactor this project with behavior-driven development (BDD) and Gherkin.
